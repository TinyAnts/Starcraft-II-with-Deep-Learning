Starcraft II with Deep Learning 🎮🕹️💻

![](b.png)

Around mid 2017, DeepMind and Blizzard (the creators of StarCraft II) announced a partnership and API for interacting with the strategy game. The point of the games are to put us against other players, or computers, where you start with a "base," which allows us to build basic units that collect resources. From here, we can build more buildings that unlock new units, like combat units, and then you can do things like purchase/research upgrades for units or for even better units. Eventually, our objective is to amass an army to take out your opponent(s). In StarCraft II, there are 3 "races:" Terran, Protoss, and Zerg.

we will be using pure Computer vision and Deep Learning here!

In future, we will try to use Deep Reinforcement Learning for better rsults.
